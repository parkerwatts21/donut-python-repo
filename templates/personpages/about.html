                    <h2 style="color: black; text-align: center;">Why we created our project</h2>
                    <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We are a group of Information Systems' students that wanted to build a website aimed 
                        at raising awareness for human trafficking. As a team, we recognized the immense 
                        scale of human trafficking as a crime that affects millions of people worldwide. 
                        We were deeply motivated to take action against this heinous crime and make a meaningful 
                        difference. Our website aims to educate others about the issue and encourage people to 
                        take action against human trafficking. Through this project, we hope to inspire others 
                        to get involved and use technology to promote social justice and create positive change in the world.</p>
